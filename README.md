PROBLEM ANALYSIS :
In today's world, many people visit restaurants and want to share their
experiences. However,the feedback is usually scattered and not
structured in a way that helps others make better dining decisions. There
is a need for a simple and efficient system to rate restaurants based on
multiple criteria such as price, food quality, service, hygiene, and location.

The programming ofthis application was informed by coding resources
and references from authoritative sources, including

IMPLEMENTATION:
• Code Description:
The code allows users to rate restaurants on a scale of 0-5 forfive criteria:
price,food quality, staff service, hygiene, and location. The ratings are
averaged to generate an overall score for each restaurant. Additionally, users
can provide optional feedback.
• Core Functions:
o calculateAverageRating : This function calculates the average offive
ratings.
o printStarRating: This function prints a visual starrepresentation based
on the rating score.
o Input and Validation:
The program ensures that each rating is between 0 and 5, and if a user
enters an invalid rating,the program prompts them to re-enter a valid
rating.
• User Interaction:
The user enters the name of the restaurant and rates it across different
criteria. The program then displays the average score and visual starrating.
Finally, users can provide additional feedback about the restaurant.
• Language and Tools Used:
The program is implemented in C using basic input/output operations. It
employs functions for modularity and ease of readability.
USE :
- For Restaurant Owners:
Restaurant owners can use this system to gather structured feedback
from customers. This helps them understand the strengths and
weaknesses of their services, food, and overall ambiance. Regularly
reviewing this feedback will help them improve their services and
customer satisfication.
- For Customers:

the average user by focusing on specific factors.
- Scaling to Multiple Restaurants:
The system can be easily scaled to handle multiple restaurant entries,
making it useful forrestaurant chains,food bloggers, or even food critics
